    <h3>We need foster homes</h3>
    <p>We need foster homes. Sometimes animals come to our shelter that need special care and that we cannot offer them in the shelter. Animals that, due to the experiences they have lived through, have lost trust in humans and need a lot of love and care to regain it. Others need some special treatment that is not possible to carry out in the shelter or animals in recovery that need more attention. For puppies, the shelter is not a good place. That is why it is also very important to take them in at home until they find a permanent home.</p>

    <h3> We need people with their own vehicle</h3>
    <p>We need people with a vehicle that can help us with the transfers of the dogs to their adopters. Sometimes they are short trips, just over an hour and other times they are longer trips, but no matter how little time you can give us, your help will be very important.</p>

    <h3>Help us take care of the animals</h3>
    <p> 
    We need people to help us take care of our dogs at the shelter, feeding them, petting them, cleaning them, caring for them and above all loving them. No matter how little time you have, one day a week, one morning, a few hours, they will notice it a lot and every morning you arrive at the shelter they will thank you by licking you to death.
